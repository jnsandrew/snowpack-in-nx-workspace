# snowpack-in-nx-workspace

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

This project is a quick example of how to serve and build an NX app with snowpack (rather than the default webpack).

1. An executor is created in tools/executors
2. Update the apps workspace json to point build and serve commands to this executor.
